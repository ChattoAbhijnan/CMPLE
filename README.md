# CMPLE
Correlation Modeling under Pairwise Likelihood Estimation using the MM algorithm
The code is for calculating estimates and the standard errors of the parameters of the correlation 
and standard deviation using the pairwise composite likelihood method.  The method is abbreviated as CMPLE for Correlation Modeling
under Pairwise Likelihood Estimation (CMPLE).
